# Projects Folder Template

This package provides individual static pages for each project.  
Duplicate a project folder and edit its `index.html` to document new work.

### Structure
```
projects-folder/
  style.css
  projects/
    project-one/
      index.html
      screenshot.png
    project-two/
      index.html
      screenshot.png
    project-three/
      index.html
      screenshot.png
```

### How to use
1. **Rename** a project folder or duplicate it for more projects.
2. Edit **`index.html`** inside each project with:
   - Project title & tagline
   - Overview description
   - Features list
   - Tech stack
   - Live demo & repo links
3. Replace `screenshot.png` with your own image (optional).
4. Keep `style.css` at the root for shared styles, or copy it into each folder if hosting separately.
5. Deploy by uploading the whole `projects-folder` directory to your hosting platform.
